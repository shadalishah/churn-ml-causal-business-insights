📄 Dataset Description
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges for subscription-based and service-oriented businesses. Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn prediction a key business analytics problem. This dataset is a synthetic but business-realistic customer churn dataset designed for machine learning, data science, and predictive analytics use cases. The data simulates real-world customer behavior by incorporating customer demographics, product usage patterns, billing and payment history, customer support interactions, and engagement metrics. The target variable, churn, indicates whether a customer is likely to discontinue the service. Churn labels are generated using business-driven rules combined with probabilistic noise, ensuring realistic feature correlations rather than random labeling. This dataset is ideal for:
